      <br />
      <Description>
        9.1. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions we are the provider
        of the Tickets.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.2. Tickets are only valid if they are obtained directly via or
        through the Website and any pages linked thereof. <br />
        <br />
        9.3. NFTs purchased directly via the DoinGud Platform will be issued to
        the specified Digital Wallet crypto address of the Purchasers and will
        grant exclusive access to claim the Tickets on the Website. You
        acknowledge and agree that at the time of claiming the Tickets, your NFT
        may not be visible on your specified Digital Wallet but may only be
        visible on DoinGud Platform and Polygonscan.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.4. The Tickets will become accessible on the Website before the
        Conference. Detailed instructions for claiming the Tickets will be
        provided over the usual communication channels established by us before
        the Conference takes place.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.5. In the process of claiming the Tickets, the NFT Holder
        agrees to provide all Personal Data required by the Website (which may
        include but is not limited to name, surname, and email) as well as by
        the Applicable Law (if any). The NFT Holder warrants that all provided
        Personal Data is true.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.6. You acknowledge that in order to access the Conference it is
        not enough to present the purchased NFTs. The purchased NFTs allow you
        to claim the Tickets will be generated in the form of a QR code, which
        has to be presented at the venue when you access the Event (hereinafter
        the “Tickets”). Previously purchased NFTs will be burned when the QR
        code will be generated for you.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.7. You acknowledge and agree to store the Tickets (QR code) and
        display them upon entering the Conference and/or Venues or show them
        upon request made by us.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.8. Upon entering the Conference and/or Venues we will scan the
        Tickets of Ticket Holders. Ticket Holders are granted exclusive,
        one-time use of the Tickets and will only be scanning them upon their
        first arrival to the Conference and/or Venues. Tickets will only be
        successfully scanned once. Upon a successful scan, the visitor of the
        Conference and/or Venues will receive a distinctive mark of our choice.
        Furthermore, the visitor will be airdropped a POAP to the same Digital
        Wallet which was used when the corresponding Tickets were claimed.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.9. Only we as the organizer have the option to scan the Tickets
        and perform the check-in procedure. A successful scan of the Tickets
        will render the QR code dysfunctional. Ticket Holder will receive a
        physical Ticket which can be displayed and presented to us upon re-entry
        to the Conference.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.10. It is the responsibility of the Ticket Holder to ensure
        that the Tickets are displayed correctly and appropriately upon entering
        the Conference and/or Venues or at any later point upon request made by
        us. For the avoidance of doubt, the Ticket Holder will be denied access
        to the Conference if the Tickets cannot be presented due to any reason
        outside our control and will not be entitled to any refund
        notwithstanding the Applicable Law. <br />
        <br />

        the Tickets. All intellectual property and other rights incorporated in
        NFTs shall remain our property at all times.

        9.12. The Tickets (QR codes) only grant Ticket Holders the right to
        access the Conference and/or Venues. All intellectual property and other
        rights incorporated in the Tickets shall remain our property at all
        times.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.13. Whilst we will take reasonable steps to ensure the
        functioning of the NFTs and Tickets, we give no warranties for absence
        of any deficiencies. Defective Tickets will be rejected at the entrance
        to the Conference. We shall not be responsible for Defective Tickets and
        will accept no obligation to reissue any such Tickets. We may, however,
        reissue such Tickets in our sole and absolute discretion if Defective
        Tickets are notified to us in writing in accordance with Section 20
        within one (1) week of occurrence of deficiency.
        <br />

        <br />
        <br /> 9.15. Once the NFTs are purchased and Tickets are obtained in
        accordance with these Terms and Conditions, the Purchaser is solely
        responsible for safeguarding the purchased NFTs and Tickets (both, the
        QR code and the physical representation of a Ticket).
        <br />
        <br />
        9.16. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for correctness of
        information required for purchasing NFTs and/or claiming the Tickets,
        since any mistakes cannot be fixed subsequently, after the purchase or
        claim (depending on what the case may be). <br />
        <br />
        9.17. If the Tickets are not received, it is the sole responsibility of
        the NFT Holder to notify us in writing in accordance with Section 20.
        <br />
        <br /> 9.18. We shall not be obliged to reissue Tickets for any lost,
        misplaced or dysfunctional Tickets. We may, however, reissue such
        Tickets in our sole and absolute discretion. In such a case, the Ticket
        Holder may be charged additional reasonable costs for issuance,
        delivery, and/or other services.

      <Title>16. Risks of Smart Contracts </Title>
      <br />
      <Description>
        16.1. You acknowledge that the purchase of NFTs, claiming of the
        Tickets, and possible airdrop of the POAPs are executed by Smart
        Contracts. You particularly acknowledge and agree that (jointly):
        <br />
        Purchasers and/or NFT Holders must voluntarily invoke one or more Smart
        Contract operations from an Digital Wallet to purchase the NFTs,
        <br /> all transactions initiated through one or more Smart Contracts
        are at the sole and absolute discretion and at the complete risk of the
        Purchasers and/or NFT Holders. The Smart Contracts are configured to
        facilitate the execution of a voluntary initiative of Purchaser and/or
        NFT Holder, an acceptance of an Offer, or other confirmation to purchase
        NFTs, and
        <br />
        transactions using Smart Contracts are inherent to several risks. By
        placing an Offer for the purchase of NFTs, the Purchaser and/or NFT
        Holder agrees to be bound by the outcome of any Smart Contract operation
        by invoking, calling, requesting, or otherwise engaging with the Smart
        Contract, whether or not the Smart Contract behaves as the Purchaser
        and/or Ticket Holder expects.
        <br />
        <br /> 16.2. You acknowledge the risk of Smart Contracts and blockchain
        technology. You particularly acknowledge and agree that the Smart
        Contract and blockchain technology, including NFTs, cryptocurrencies,
        consensus algorithms, and decentralized or peer-to-peer networks and
        systems are still developing and in may be in the early phases of
        innovation. You acknowledge and agree that such technologies are
        experimental, speculative, and inherently risky, and that the Smart
        Contracts facilitating transactions for the purpose of our NFTs and
        Tickets may be subject to bugs, malfunctions, timing errors, hacking and
        theft, or changes to the protocol rules of the underlying blockchain
        protocol ("forks"), which can adversely affect the Smart Contracts and
        may expose you to a risk of total loss, forfeiture of your digital
        currency or Tickets, or lost opportunities to buy or sell Tickets. We
        are not liable or responsible for any such Smart Contract or related
        failures, risks, or uncertainties.
        <br />
        <br /> 16.3. You acknowledge the risk of interacting with Smart
        Contract. You particularly acknowledge that you assume the risk of
        purchasing NFTs and take full responsibility and liability for the
        outcome of any purchase you initiate, whether or not the Smart
        Contracts, the DoinGud Platform and any pages linked thereof, the
        Website or other market participants behave as expected or intended. You
        also agree and acknowledge that you are knowledgeable, experienced and
        sophisticated in using blockchain technology and in initiating
        transactions through Polygon or other selected networks.
        <br />
        <br /> 16.4. You acknowledge that Smart Contracts are not controlled by
        us. All purchases of NFTs are executed by one or more Smart Contracts
        processed on the Polygon Network and not under any direct control by us.
        <br />
        <br /> 16.5. You acknowledge that we reserve the right to execute Smart
        Contract transaction on the DoinGud Platform and any pages linked
        thereof.
        <br />
        <br /> 16.6. You acknowledge that you are forbidden from engaging in any
        attack, hack, denial-of-service attack, interference, or exploit of any
        Smart Contract. Even if certain operations are technically permitted by
        a Smart Contract, they may nevertheless constitute a violation of these
        Terms of Conditions and the Applicable Law.

        responsible for such loss or damage suffered by the Ticket Holder which
        was reasonably foreseeable or contemplated as a result of the breach at
        the time the Purchaser entered into a contract with us by virtue of
        these Terms and Conditions. Nevertheless, we shall not be liable for any
        business losses of the Ticket Holder, including but not limited to any

        <br />
        <br /> 17.6. We shall not be responsible for any interruptions and/or
        restrictions to the view of the Conference and/or Venues caused by the
        actions of other visitors.
        <br />
        <br /> 17.7. We shall not be responsible or liable for any failure to
        perform any obligation under these Terms and Conditions to the extent
        that the failure:
        <br /> 1.Can be attributed to risks of Smart Contracts as set forth in
        Section 16, or <br />
        2.is caused by an event of Force Majeure as set forth in Section 12.
        <br />
        <br /> 17.8. To the maximum extent permitted by the Applicable Law, we
        shall not be liable for neither:
