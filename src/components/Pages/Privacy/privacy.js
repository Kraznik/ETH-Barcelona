        <Description>
          5.1. TRANSMITTING OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES <br /> <br /> Your
          Personal Data may be, exclusively in order to achieve the purpose for
          which it was collected, transmitted, or we may allow access to them to
          certain third parties (defined below in this Section). Such third
          parties may only process your Personal Data for the purposes for which
          they were collected. <br /> <br /> Accordingly, any third party to
          whom we transmit Personal Data is bound to comply with the Applicable
          Law as well as to the provisions of this Privacy Policy. With external
          processors, however, the protection of Personal Data is further
          defined by the contract. <br /> <br /> We may transmit your Personal
          Data to third parties (defined below in this Section) for the purposes
          and pursuant to legal basis highlighted in this Privacy Policy (see
          Section 3) based outside the EU and EEA, where Personal Data
          processing occurs. <br /> <br /> PERSONAL DATA SHARED AMONG USE AND
          WITH EXTERNAL PROCESSORS <br /> We share your Personal Data among us
          for the purposes highlighted in this Privacy Policy. Annex 2 of this
          Privacy Policy provides more information about where we work together
          to process your Personal Data. <br /> <br /> Where expressly indicated
          in this Privacy Policy (and to the extent permitted by Applicable
          Law), we share your Personal Data with our partners. This includes
          Personal Data collected through the Services (for example, where you
          subscribe to receive promotional communications) or by other
          organizations that we work with and who take care of our needs (for
          example, accounting services, law firms, marketing services). Annex 3
          of this Privacy Policy provides more information about external
          processors, the situations in which we share Personal Data with them
          and the purposes for which they may use such Personal Data. <br />{" "}
          <br /> PERSONAL DATA SHARED WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS <br /> We rely
          on a network of professional service providers (i.e. providers who
          provide hosting services, email communications and push notification
          services) who are working on our behalf and help us to operate,
          develop, secure, promote and measure the Services and our
          advertisements. <br /> <br /> Where we delegate part of the processing
          of your Personal Data to these organizations we transfer your Personal
          Data to them. A list of our main service providers (including, for
          each service provider, the country to which Personal Data is
          transferred and their contact information) is provided in Annex 1 of
          this Privacy Policy. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the organizations we
          work with may act as Controllers of your Personal Data. For example,
          third parties that assist us with the serving of advertisements, and
          those third parties authorized to launch and operate digital services
          or to use our brands. These third parties are typically governed by
          their own terms and conditions, terms of service, and privacy
          policies, which we strongly recommend you read. <br /> <br /> 5.2.
          INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER <br />
          We may store, process, and transfer your Personal Data in a country
          other than your place of residence (outside your residence
          jurisdiction), especially for the purpose of hosting the website (e.g.
          through the services provided by Firebase Hosting). <br /> <br /> The
          Personal Data we collect will usually be processed in the EU or EEA.
          We may, however, disclose and transfer your Personal Data to third
          parties outside the EU and EEA for the purposes and legal basis for
          processing highlighted in this Privacy Policy (see Section 3). Some of
          these third parties may be based in countries that do not provide in
          their laws for a level of protection of your privacy equivalent to
          that applied within the EU. <br /> <br /> To the extent you are a
          resident of a country other than the United States, you consent to the
          transfer of such data to the United States for processing by us in
          accordance with this Privacy Policy. <br /> <br />

        <br />
        <Description>
          Although we own the code, databases, and all rights to our platform
          and services, Individual retains all rights to his/her data. The
          Individual has the following rights regarding the Personal Data
          processing:
          <br />
          <br /> RIGHT OF ACCESS <br />
          Each Individual shall have the right to obtain from the Controller
          confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her
          are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the
          personal data listed in article 15 (1) of the GDPR. <br />
          <br /> The Controller shall provide free information about the
          Individual’s Personal Data stored at any time and a copy of this
          information.
          <br />
          <br />
          Furthermore, the Individual shall have a right to obtain information
          as to whether Personal Data is transferred to a third country or to an
          international organization. Where this is the case, the Individual
          shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards
          relating to the transfer.
          <br />
          <br /> RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION (CORRECTION)
          <br /> Each Individual shall have the right to obtain from the
          Controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate
          Personal Data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes
          of the processing, the Individual shall have the right to have
          incomplete Personal Data completed, including by means of providing a
          supplementary statement.
          <br />
          <br /> RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN (RIGHT TO ERASURE, DELETION)

          <br />
          Where the Controller has made Personal Data public and is obliged
          pursuant to Article 17 (1) of the GDPR to erase the Personal Data, the
          Controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of
          implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical

          that the Individual has requested erasure by such Controllers of any
          links to, or copy or replication of, those Personal Data, as far as
          processing is not required. Our staff will arrange the necessary
          measures in individual cases.

          structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall
          have the right to transmit those data to another Controller without
          hindrance from the Controller to which the Personal Data have been
          provided, as long as the processing is based on Consent pursuant to
          point (a) of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9 (2)
          of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of
          the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as
          long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task
          carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
          authority vested in the Controller.
          <br />
          <br /> Furthermore, in exercising his/her right to data portability
          pursuant to Article 20 (1) of the GDPR, the Individual shall have the
          right to have Personal Data transmitted directly from one Controller
          to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not
          adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

          <br /> RIGHT TO OBJECT
          <br /> Each Individual shall have the right to object, on grounds
          relating to his/her particular situation, at any time, to processing
          of Personal Data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or
          (f) of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based
          on these provisions.
          <br />
          <br /> If we process Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, the
          Individual shall have the right to object at any time to processing of
          Personal Data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies
          to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct
          marketing.
          <br />
          <br /> In addition to exercising the rights in accordance with Section
          10, the Individual is free in the context of the use of information
          society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use
          his/her right to object by automated means using technical
          specifications.
          <br />
          <br /> AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING
          <br /> (INCLUDING PROFILING) We do not use any form of automated
          processing of personal data or profiling.
